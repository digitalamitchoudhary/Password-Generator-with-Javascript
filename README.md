# 🔐 Password Generator

We’ve all been there — signing up for a new account, stuck trying to come up with a "strong" password. You mash your keyboard, end up with something like `qwe123!`, and hope for the best.

This project is a simple, no-nonsense **Password Generator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps you create strong, random, and secure passwords with just one click.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I needed a lightweight tool to generate random passwords while working on a few side projects. Instead of reaching for a bulky online generator, I decided to build my own — one that’s fast, private, and completely customizable.

Now, I’m sharing it with you!
